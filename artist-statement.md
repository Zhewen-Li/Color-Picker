# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

I want to make a color picker which contains multiple interaction, not just one form of clicking. So, except the basic color picking part, I planned to create a slider, and drawing pad to make further changes and show the picking result.

The color picker I created combines three parts.

First, I create several bars for multiple colors to let people choose as stage one. When viewing it in browser, you can click on each bar and the following section will display the color you have chosen. Besides, when your cursor is over the bars, it will show you the picking color as well.

Second, I chose a slider to help change the saturation of the color which was picked in stage one, and that made stage two. For this part, I was inspired by the Slider example form p5.js

Third, I create a blank space which was a drawing pad in the right corner to let people try their picked color after two stages with mouse pressed. 


(Actually, I planned to have one more function at first which was changing another group of color for bars by pressing space key, however, I had some difficulty haddling with my recursion which made my code seemed long and complex. So for this assignment, I gave up this trying but I will figure it out later. )
